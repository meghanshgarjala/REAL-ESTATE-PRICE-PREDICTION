# Real Estate Price Prediction

## Project Overview

The Real Estate Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts property prices based on various features. By analyzing historical data, the model provides insights into pricing trends, helping buyers, sellers, and real estate agents make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathered data from multiple sources, including property listings, historical sale prices, and regional economic indicators.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numerical features to improve model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluated various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines, to identify the most effective algorithm for price prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Utilized metrics such as RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess model accuracy and performance.
- **User Interface**: Developed a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input property features and receive instant price predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, Streamlit, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code


### Conclusion
The Real Estate Price Prediction project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in the real estate market. With continuous improvements, this model can become an invaluable tool for stakeholders in the real estate industry, providing accurate price forecasts and assisting in better decision-making.
